This file is updated with the new `tools` and `run` commands.

### **`man.txt`**

I've updated the `analyze` command section to reflect the new subcommands: `topk`, `search`, `exact`, `tools`, and `run`.

M3(1)                            User Manuals                            M3(1)NAMEm3 - a local-first document analysis toolkitSYNOPSISm3 [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...   m3 --go

   m3 --batch <FILENAME>
DESCRIPTIONm3 (monkey3) is a command-line tool designed for managing andpreparing collections of text documents for semantic analysis.
Itprovides a project-based workflow to ingest documents in variousformats (.txt, .pdf, .docx), track their versions, and convert theircontent into a searchable vector store using local, self-hostedembedding models.MODES OF OPERATIONCommand-line modeExecute a single command and exit.
This is the default mode.   Interactive mode (--go)
          Enter a read-eval-print loop (REPL) for executing multiple
          commands in a session.
In this mode, all commands must be
          preceded by a forward slash (/).
For example: /project list.

   Batch mode (--batch <FILENAME>)
          Execute a sequence of m3 commands from a specified text file.
Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
COMMANDSThe following commands are available:   project
          Commands for managing projects.
create <PROJECT_NAME>
                 Creates a new, empty project with a corpus and a vector
                 store.
list
                 Lists all available projects.
An (active) marker
                 indicates the current project.
active <PROJECT_NAME>
                 Sets the active project for the current session.
remove <PROJECT_NAME>
                 Permanently deletes a project and all its associated
                 data, including the corpus and vector store.
dialogue <PROJECT_NAME>
                 (Placeholder) Starts an interactive dialogue session
                 with the project's data.
corpus
          Commands for managing the active project's corpus.
add <PATH>[ <PATH>]...
                 Adds one or more files to the active project's corpus.
The path can be a single file, a directory (all files
                 within will be added recursively), or a wildcard pattern
                 (e.g., "data/*.txt").
remove <FILENAME>
                 Removes a file from the active project's corpus and its
                 corresponding entries from the vector store.
list
                 Lists all files in the active project's corpus,
                 including their version number and unique ID (UUID).
ingest
                 Processes all new or updated files in the corpus,
                 converts them to text, and stores them as vector
                 embeddings in the project's vector store.
vector
          Commands for managing the active project's vector store.
status
                 Displays a detailed status of the vector store, including
                 its location, the number of indexed text chunks, and the
                 active embedding model configuration.
create
                 Creates a new, blank vector store for the active project.
If a store already exists, it will be wiped clean.
This
                 is useful for resetting a corrupted store or starting an
                 ingestion from scratch.
chunks <FILENAME>
                 Retrieves and displays the text content of all chunks
                 for a specific file that has been ingested into the
                 vector store.
Useful for debugging the text-splitting
                 process.
analyze
          Commands for analyzing project data.
          topk <QUERY> [--k N]
                 Finds the Top-K most semantically similar chunks.
          search <QUERY> [--threshold N]
                 Finds all chunks that meet a similarity threshold.
          exact <QUERY_TERM>
                 Finds all chunks with an exact string match.
          tools
                 Lists all available analysis plugins.
          run <PLUGIN_NAME>
                 Runs a specific analysis plugin.
CONFIGURATION
    The main configuration is stored in ~/.monkey3/config.yaml.
This file
    controls the embedding models and other settings.
embedding_profiles
    Defines one or more profiles for the ingestion process.
Each
    profile specifies the embed_model (from Hugging Face), the
   chunk_size, and the chunk_overlap.
active_profile
          Specifies which of the embedding_profiles to use when running
          the /corpus ingest command.
FILES
    ~/.monkey3/The base directory for all m3 data and configuration.
~/.monkey3/config.yaml
          The global configuration file.
~/.monkey3/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/
          The directory for a specific project.
~/.monkey3/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/corpus/
          Contains the original documents and the manifest.
~/.monkey3/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/corpus/corpus_manifest.json
          A JSON file that tracks every file in the corpus, including
          its version, content hash, and unique ID.
~/.monkey3/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/vector_store/
          Contains the ChromaDB persistent vector store.
EXAMPLES
A typical workflow:   # Create and activate a new project
   $ m3 project create my_research
   $ m3 project active my_research

   # Add all text files from a local directory
   $ m3 corpus add "path/to/notes/*.txt"

   # Ingest the files into the vector store
   $ m3 corpus ingest

   # Check the status
   $ m3 vector status

   # Inspect the chunks for a specific file
   $ m3 vector chunks my_document.txt
